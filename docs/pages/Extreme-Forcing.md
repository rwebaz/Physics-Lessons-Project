### The Rise of Entropy

Are we at some type of **Fixed Point** far away from **Equilibrium** that vigorously iterates through countless reaction cycles the goal of which is to harvest the maximum amount of energy possible from the environment?

## Information Processing

More to come ...

## Chemotaxis

## Reproduction of Species

As long as you can harvest energy (dollars) from your environment, order will spontaneously arise and self-tune.
